Therefore, we need to split the 5,000 time steps into multiple shorter sub-sequences. There are many ways to do this, and you may want to explore some depending on your problem. For example, perhaps\n",
    "you need overlapping sequences, perhaps non-overlapping is good but your model needs state across the sub-sequences and so on. In this example, we will split the 5,000 time steps into 25 sub-sequences of 200 time steps each. Rather than using NumPy or Python tricks, we will do this the old fashioned way so you can see what is going on."
